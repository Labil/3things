A micro-blog for positive thinking!
Live @ http://hakestad.io/threethings/?user=Labil  (Links to my own profile, as the welcome page is a bit ugly atm)

TODOS:

x Add search user functionality

x Fix the design and styling, looks kinda shit now

x Implement unfollow & unlike

x "News" feed bar on the side, which shows your followers activity

x Fix the cron job so that it doesn't add a new post to a user, if the user registered that same day (cause it will double)

x Set database to my own timezone

x Show 1 month at a time, with archive

x Split & clean up js giant file

x Hook up with instagram api to display 1 image from each day (if any)
